will be the closest multiple of BLOCKSIZE that is lower than nByte (but greater than 0) If 
nBytes is less than BLOCKSIZE failure should be returned. If nBytes > BLOCKSIZE and there 
is already a file by the given filename, that file’s content may be overwritten. If nBytes

‘disk’) and copies the result into a local buffer (must be at least of BLOCKSIZE bytes). The 
bNum is a logical block number, which must be translated into a byte offset within the disk. 
The translation from logical to physical block is straightforward: bNum=0 is the very first 
byte of the file. bNum=1 is BLOCKSIZE bytes into the disk, bNum=n is n*BLOCKSIZE bytes into 
the disk. On success, it returns 0. -1 or smaller is returned if disk is not available (hasn’t 
been opened) or any other failures. You must define your own error code system. */

readBlock(), writeBlock() must translate the logical block bNum to the correct byte position 
in the file. On success, it returns 0. -1 or smaller is returned if disk is not available
