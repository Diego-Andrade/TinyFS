Our TinyFS works pretty well, having all the core functionality. We attempted to make it as modular as possible, allowing for different blocksize, block address sizes and different block structures.

Trade offs:
    We have chosen to go with and index based list for file extends. This was done to ensure a single corrupted block will not cause us to lose all data.

    We have also implemented a linked base inode extention as opposed to a nested index one. This one done inorder to simplify the logic and take advantage of our fimilarity with linked list to ensure quick development.

Features:
    We have implemented the following features:
        - tfs_rename
        - tfs_readdir
        - tfs_makeRO
        - tfs_makeRW 
        -tfs_writeByte


Limitations:
    Our current limitation is the size of block number address. Currently it is set to 2 Bytes, for a total of 65535 addressable blocks.

    Another limitation is the index based approach mentioned earlier, as a lot of data space is being wasted towards indexing.
